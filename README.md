In a few sentences describe what your project is trying to solve.

**We are planing to launch a flappy birds successor**
<br>the base idea is to create a simple version of flappy bird, where a bird or another icon jumps across the screen through gates. 
<br>Each gate you pass, will add one score point on your current score. In case we achieve a sufficient level of the game within the period of this course, we will also try to implement a highscore system.
<br>
<br>The game should run within a separate window with a limited screensize. 
<br><br>
<sub>**first step:** trying to create a separate window, that opens when you run the app and import libraries that allow to run a game within python.</sub>
<br>
<sub>**second step:** importing images, backgrounds and playericons that will then at a certain point move across the screen.</sub><br>
<sub>**third step:** now we want to start with the gate creation, giving the entire game a challenge.</sub><br>
<sub>**fourth step:** to now not make the game buggy, we implement collision detection with the gates and the screen border, this limits the movement through each gate.</sub><br>
<sub>**step five:** Scoring system and game over detection - when the player jumps through a gate, the score should increase by 1 point, when a player rams into a gate, the game should end immediately.</sub><br>
<sub>**step six:** game loop, to restart the game within the game, not having to relaunch it via VSCode.</sub><br>
<sub>**step seven:** develop a highscore system, that allows to track your best result in game.</sub><br>
<sub>**additional steps:** indeally, if all steps above are completed, we will improve the visuals of the game, including a background and more, try fixing bugs and so on.</sub><br>


## Get started

Explain what the user has to type to get started with your solution. Which one
is the main Python file? In the simplest case, this could look something like
this:

``
    python main.py
``

In other cases the user might first have to install some project dependencies
first has to run something like this (a sample requirements.txt file is also
included in the project template):

``
    pip install -r requirements.txt
``

## Understanding the sources

Explain any high level concepts that you are using in your software. What were
your ideas for creating the whole software? What might not be apparent from the
sources alone? You can also add diagrams, photos of whiteboards or flipcharts
or even crudly drawing napkin sketches of the core concepts of your software
when they are readable and helpful for understanding.
